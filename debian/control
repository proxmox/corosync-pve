X-Common-Description: The Corosync Cluster Engine is a Group Communication
 System with additional features for implementing high availability within
 applications. The project provides four C Application Programming Interface
 features:
 .
  * A closed process group communication model with virtual synchrony
    guarantees for creating replicated state machines.
  * A simple availability manager that restarts the application process
    when it has failed.
  * A configuration and statistics in-memory database that provide the
    ability to set, retrieve, and receive change notifications of
    information.
  * A quorum system that notifies applications when quorum is achieved
    or lost.
